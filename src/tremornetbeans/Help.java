With the file\nselection you can find your file and open it.\nOnce you click open you will see the file\npath replace the text \"filename.csv\".\n\nFormat:\nThe format is the type of layout of the file. \nEnter only the numbers 1-4 into this text field\nor the program will error/terminate.\n\nDepending on how you converted the ActiLife \ndata into a CSV file is how you know which\nformat to choose. If you opened the file in\nActiLife and then converted it, you will use \neither 1 or 4 depending on if the file is in \nseconds or minutes. If you did not open the\nfile in ActiLife and only used ActiLife to \nconvert the file, you will use either 2 or 3.\n\nTo know which type of file it could be when \nyou were not the user that converted the file,\nlook at the file name.\nIf the file name contains \"DataTable\", then\nthe file is format 1 or 4. If \"DataTable\" is\nnot in the file title, then it is format 2 or 3.\n\nTo know if the file is in minute or second \nincrements, look to the file title. If the title\ncontains \"60secs\" then the file is in minute\nincrements. If the title contains \"1sec\" then the\nfile is in second increments.\n\nThe format choices are as follows:\n1 - The data is in minute increments.\n2 - The data is in second increments.\n3 - Alternate choice for minute increments. \n4 - Alternate choice for second increments. \n\nBE PATIENT (Phantom Freeze)\nThe program takes some time to read the file. \nAfter closing the window that prompts you \nabout the loading time, the threshold window \nwill pop up within a few minutes. If it takes \nlonger than a few minutes exit the program and \ntry again. If the program continues to do \nthis, try the alternate format option for the\nfiles type of incements.\nFor example, if the number you entered for \nformat was 1 (file is in minute increments)\nthen the alternate format would be 3.\n\n------ENTERING IN MULTIPLE FILES------\nTo enter in multiple files you enter your first\nfile and hit enter. Then you will be prompted\nabout whether or not you would like to read in \nanother file. Once you click yes click the text\nfield where you entered in the first file. Once\nit is finished loading the first file it will \nthen pop up the file search menu. Once you \nselect your file and hit enter it will prompt you\nagain. This cycle continues until all files wanted\nare entered. \nPlease note that the more files you enter, the \nlonger it will take to load each file. \n  \n\n------ENTERING IN THRESHOLDS------\nThe starting heart rate threshold must be \nHIGHER than the ending heart rate tremor.\nDefault Thresholds:\nStarting Heart-rate: 120 \nEnding Heart-rate: 100\nMovement: 5000 \nThresholds are what helps the program\ndefine a tremor when processing the file.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - FILE------\nThis is the option to view the raw file that \nwas read in. It gives every min/sec from the \ndevice. This option takes a while to load, \nPlease be patient. Got to the LOAD section for\nmore information. There is also a save \nfunction on this window, Please refer to SAVE \nsection.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - EVENTS------\nThis is the option to view all tremor events.\nIt gives you information about what is happen\nduring each tremor. There is also a save \nfunction on this window, Please refer to SAVE \nsection.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - DAILY EVENTS------\nThis is the option to view how many tremors \nhappened per day in the file and gives \nstatistics about the tremors each day. \nOn days that show 0 tremors, the statistics shown\nare for the day overall since there is not any \ntremor data to average. \nThere is also a save function on this window.\nPlease refer to SAVE section.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - STATISTICS------\nThis is to view the overall statistics about \nthe file regarding the tremors. This is where\nyou see the mean, max, min and other \ncalculations. There is also a save function on\nthis window, Please refer to SAVE section.\n\n------VIEW OPTION - OVERALL------\nThis is to view the overall statistic about each\nday. You will see mean, max, min and other\ncalculations concerning each day.\nThere is also a save function on this window,\nPlease refer to SAVE section.\n\n------SAVE------\nWhen ever you save a file using one of the \nview option windows, it saves using the file\nselection. Find where you would like to save\nyour file then type what you would like your\nfile to be titled then hit save.\nYou will find your file where you selected to \nsave it. If you forgot to select where to \nsave it, you will find it in your documents \nfolder.\n\n------LOAD------\nThe load time required for your file depends on \nhow large of a file it is. The loading process\ncan take anywhere between 3minutes to an hour. It could \ntake longer if you have chosen to load many files at\none time. This only applies to when ou chose the \nfile button for the view options menu.\nPlease note that although the program seems\nunresponsive after clicking the file button, \nit is a sign that it is loading your request.\n\n------CLEAR------\nTo clear the \"filename.csv\" and the \"format\"\ntext fields, click the clear button right \nbelow the enter button and it will clear.\n");
